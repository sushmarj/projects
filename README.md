# REST API 

### `React Application`

Go through the sample JSON file given here -
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xZa3UoXZ3uj2j0Q7653iBp1NrT0gKj0Y
This JSON file describes a list of users & their corresponding periods of activity across multiple months. Need to extrapolate this json sample to get a JSON sample for
powering your mock API and your UI.

Design and implement a user interface that allows a user to view a list of hardcodedusers from a mock API server. On clicking on any user, a modal should open which displays
all the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the
periods of activity for different days using a calendar.
